They miss important keywords and don't know what to improve.

1. Extracts key information from a resume
2. Compares it against a job description
3. Suggests specific improvements and missing keywords
4. Searches for industry-relevant keywords online

### Agents

- Extractor Agent: Pulls out skills, experience, education from resume
- Analyzer Agent: Finds matching and missing keywords
- Suggester Agent: Recommends improvements and generates report
